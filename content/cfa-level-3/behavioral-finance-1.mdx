## Behavioral Finance

<Note>
  Interestingly, society seems to be more comfortable when prices are driven
  above fair value than when they are driven below fair value.
</Note>

### Traditional Finance Perspective

- The price is right - Asset prices reflect, and instantly adjust to, all available information
- No free lunch - No manager should be able to generate excess returns (alphas) in the long run
- Assumes investors exhibit risk aversion and make unbiased, utility-maximizing decisions that would be considered appropriate for a rational economic man (REM)
- REM will always selfishly seek the personal utility-maximizing decision based on all available information
- REM is assumed to act rationally in a perfectly self-interested manner as if ignoring others' utility, except for any personal utility derived from helping others (e.g., serving in the military, serving in a religious capacity)
- Traditional finance is considered a holistic strategy (i.e., consider all goals simultaneously and uses a single portfolio to achieve them)
- With the receipt of new, relevant information REM will revise expectations utilizing a Bayesian framework

### Bayesian Framework

- A Bayesian process involves evaluating new information on its own to apply the proper base rate rating

<Math>{"P(A|B) = P(event|new information)"}</Math>
<Math>{"P(B|A) = P(new information|event) "}</Math>
<Math>{"P(A) = Prior probability of event "}</Math>
<Math>{"P(B) = Unconditional probability of new information"}</Math>
<Math>{"P(B) = P(B|A) $\\cdot$ P(A) + P(B|Ac) $\\cdot$ P(Ac)"}</Math>

- REM makes decisions conforming to the 4 Axioms of Utility ("CTIC"):
  1. Completeness
     - Individuals know their preferences and use them to choose between any two mutually exclusive alternatives
  2. Transitivity
     - Individuals consistently apply their completeness rankings. If A > B and B >C, then A > C
  3. Independence
     - Rankings are additive and proportional. If A and B are mutually exclusive choices where A > B and C is an additional choice, then A + x(C) will be preferred to B + x(C)
  4. Continuity
     - Utility indifference curves are continuous

## Behavioral Finance Perspective

- Assumes investors employ some combination of traditional finance and psychological biases when making investment decisions
- Psychological biases (psychological traps) can result in biased capital market allocations and expectations
- Focuses on why investors make their decisions, not how they make decisions

### Microbehavioral Finance

- Describes the decision-making processes of individuals
- Tries to explain why individuals deviate from traditional finance theory

### Macrobehavioral Finance

- Seeks to explain how and why markets deviate from "efficient form"
