## Alpha and Beta Drivers

### Alternative Assets

- Specialized investment strategies that often utilize traditional asset classes (equities & fixed income)

### Alternative Asset Features

1. Increased opportunity of investments
2. Trade in private markets

### Types of Alternative Assets

1. Hedge funds
2. Commodities and managed futures
3. Private equity
4. Credit derivatives
5. Real estate

### Super Asset Classes

1. Capital assets (equities & fixed income - claim on a firm's cash flows)
2. Assets used as inputs to create value - consumed or transformed to create another asset
3. Assets that store value - no cash flows and not transformed

### Primary Asset Classes

1. Equity
2. Fixed income
3. Cash
4. Real estate

- Most alternative investments are extensions of the four (4) primary asset classes.

### Asset Allocation

1. Strategic asset allocation - long-term policy allocation based on investor risk tolerance, used to fund long-term liabilities
2. Tactical asset allocation - process of taking advantage of current market conditions, used to generate excess returns

- Alternative assets should only be considered within tactical asset allocation (adds depth to the primary asset classes, not used to hedge primary asset classes).

### Valuation

- Without a public market, the value of alternative investments must be estimated using book value, an appraised value , or a discounted cash flow model.

- Research has shown that mutual fund returns are primarily based on asset location, while hedge fund returns are determined by the trading strategy of the fund.

### Primary Differences between Alternative Assets and Domestic Equities…that effect Efficiency

1. Alternative assets must be purchased from an intermediary (e.g. LLC or Limited Partnership)
2. Alternative assets are less liquid than equities
3. Alternative asset managers have unconstrained investing parameters; typical equity funds have investment constraints

### Equity Risk Premium

- Long-term expected return of equity over risk-free return
- ERP ≈ 3.8% in long run
- Investors will create efficient frontiers

### Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA)

- Long-term policy allocation based on investor risk tolerance, used to fund long-term liabilities
- Policy (beta, or market risk) risk is established in the SAA.

### Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)

- Process of taking advantage of current market conditions, used to generate excess returns

After a SAA is set, managers will seek alpha within the asset classes through TAA.

### Beta Drivers

Exposures to market risk factors

The level of beta risk is measured by a linear regression of asset returns vs. market returns

### Alpha Drivers

- Exposures to active return factors
- Investment strategy, not asset class or location, determine if an investment is an alpha driver

### Categories of Alpha Drivers

- Long/short investments - market neutral investments (Beta = 0), typically net long investments
- Absolute return investments - seek alpha wherever present, not constrained to a benchmark, investment style, or strategy (e.g. long/short, market neutral to earn alpha)

- Segmented markets - markets that investors often avoid, often less efficient (e.g. commodities, real estate, distressed debt)

- Portfolio concentration - make large bets on a few securities, assume greater tracking error in an attempt to earn higher alphas

- Nonlinear return distributions - investments with option-like payoffs (e.g. merger arbitrage, event-driven, managed futures funds)

- Alternative beta exposures (cheap beta) - investments intended to expand portfolio beta beyond normal stock/bond beta (e.g. currencies, real estate, commodities)

### Traditional Asset Allocation

- Management attempts to extract alpha from beta through the asset allocation process
- Due to market efficiencies, this results in minimal alphas

### New Asset Allocation

- Instead of extracting alpha from beta, managers should consider dividing their portfolio into an alpha driver component and a beta driver component

1. Beta drivers should be primarily used to obtain systematic market exposure, not to generate active returns.
2. The majority of capital and human resources should be spent on pursuing alpha driver investments.

### The Beta Continuum

### Alpha

- A risk-adjusted measure of return that accounts for exposures to certain risk factors or benchmarks

### Beta

- Measures the linear exposure of a fund's systematic risk and can be obtained without active management

#### Classical Beta (CAPM Beta)

- Measures exposure of a security relative to a major market index and measures systematic risk
- Classical beta products utilize the capital asset pricing model

#### Bespoke Beta (Custom Beta)

- Measures exposure of a security relative to a local risk factor (e.g. sector, style, size, country)
- ETFs are an example of a bespoke beta investment

#### Alternative Beta

- Measures exposure of a security relative to alternative systematic risks
- Currencies, commodities, and real estate are examples of alternative beta investments

#### Fundamental Beta

- Measures exposure of a security relative to factors other than capitalization (e.g. dividend payout)
- A dividend-payout-weighted ETF is an example of a fundamental beta investment

#### Endogenous Alpha

- Excess return caused by index construction

#### Exogenous Alpha

- Excess return caused by active management skill

#### Cheap Beta

- Investments whose systematic risks are underpriced
- Relies on hedging expensive beta exposures

#### Active Beta

- Investments whose systematic risks are used to achieve excess returns
- 130/30 investments are an example of an active beta investment (Enhanced index)
- Active beta investments use quantitative tools or strategies to earn excess returns
- Beta One investments retain beta exposures equal to 1.

#### Bulk Beta

- Rely primarily on systematic risk to generate the bulk of their returns
- Bulk beta products are designed to provide both systematic and active risk exposures
