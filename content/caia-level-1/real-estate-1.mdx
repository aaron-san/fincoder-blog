## Real Estate

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)

#### Advantages of REITs

- No Corporate Taxation: REITs avoid double taxation
- Pension funds, endowments, and foundations are tax-exempt organizations
- Liquidity: REITs trade on a stock exchange
- Asset Allocation: Investors can easily change their allocation to real estate
- Professional Management: REIT managers are highly skilled
- Income: REITs are required to distribute 95% of income to shareholders
- Corporate Governance: REITs have independent Boards of Governors

#### Disadvantages of REITs

- Systematic Risk: REITS are highly correlated with small and middle capitalization stocks, which tend to be more volatile
- Individual Taxation: with their pass-through status, REIT dividends are not eligible for the 15% qualified dividend tax rate and instead pay taxes on REIT dividends according to their ordinary income tax rates
