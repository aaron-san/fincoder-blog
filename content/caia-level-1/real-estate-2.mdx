- Rental payments tend to increase with inflation
- Investors reposition their portfolios toward real assets during inflationary periods

## Introduction to NCREIF and the NCREIF Indexes

- Conduct and publish research

### NCREIF Property Index (NPI)

- Created to measure the performance of income-producing real properties

#### Effects of Smoothing

1. Lagging values
2. Low volatility
3. Low correlation

#### Unsmoothing Methods

1. Use current transactions
2. Hedonic price index - uses actual transactions that attributes property value changes to property charactersistics
3. Use only revalued properties
4. Econometric adjustment - use current appraisals, previous appraisal, and a decay parameter

<Math>
  {
    "$RE_{true(t)}=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}RE_{appraised(t)}-\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}RE_{appraised(t-1)}$"
  }
</Math>
where: alpha is a decay parameter (alpha = 0.4 according to Fischer)

#### National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) index

- Composed of publicly-traded REITs

### Real Estate as an Investment

#### Real Estate Investment Goals

- Ample cash flows
- Returns in excess of risk-free rate
- Inflation hedge
- Better reflect the global investment opportunity set
- Provide diversification

<Note>
  Note: Direct investments in real estate (NPI indices and subindices) achieve
  all 5 goals. Indirect investments (NAREIT index) achieve 4 goals, but do not
  provide inflation hedging.
