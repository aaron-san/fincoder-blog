##### Results

- NPI - Index and its subindices have strong diversification potential when combined with traditional assets (stock and bonds)
- Traditional asset classes do not provide inflation protection (low correlation with inflation)
- REITs do not provide inflation protection (low correlation with inflation)
- Direct real estate (NPI indices) provides the greatest improvement in the efficient frontier. (shift curve "up and to the left")
- REITs provide improvement in the efficient frontier (shift curve "up" only)
- REITs tend to diversify bond portfolios very well and diversify large stock portfolios better than small stock portfolios.

#### Core, Value-Added, and Opportunistic Real Estate

##### Reasons for Classifying Real Estate

- Obtain style diversification
- Monitor style drift
- Measure performance

##### Real Estate Investment Styles

- Core: large percentage of returns from cash flow, low volatility

  - Retail, offices, apartment, industrial
  - Low leverage
  - High occupancy
  - Full operating (i.e. leased)
  - Returns should fall within 25th and 75th percentiles (interquartile range)
  - Expected return: 9%-10% (absolute), NPI return (relative)
  - Volatility: 11%

- Value-Added: significant percentage of returns from price appreciation, moderate volatility

  - retail, offices, apartments, industrial, storage, healthcare, hospitality, low-income
  - Moderate leverage
  - Moderate to well-leased, pre-leased development
  - Operating and leasing
  - Returns should fall within 5th and 25th percentiles initially, then within 75th and 95th percentiles
  - Required return: 10%-13% (absolute), NPI + 200 bps (relative)
  - Volatility: 10%-13%

- Opportunistic: returns primarily from price appreciation, high volatility due to leverage, development risk, leasing risk, or a combination of moderate risk factors

  - Nontraditional properties, speculative development, raw land
  - High leverage
  - Low occupancy
  - New construction and development
  - Returns should fall below 5th percentile initially, then above 95th percentile
  - Required return: ≥13% (absolute), ≥NPI + 500 bps (relative)
  - Volatility: ≥13%

#### Private Equity Real Estate (PERE)

- Funds used to gain exposure to opportunistic real estate, especially when located in a foreign nation
- Major Risks

  - Zoning and public policy risk
  - Development risk
  - Currency risk
  - Tenant risk
  - Property turnaround risk

- For real estate, the relative return is expressed relative to the NPI (NCREIF Property Index).

- Many real estate investments made in foreign countries are taxable in the domestic country.
