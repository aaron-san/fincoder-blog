Interest rates drive the cost of borrowing, influence consumer spending, and affect the value of nearly every investment. When the Federal Reserve adjusts its policy rate, the effects spread across the entire financial system.

This post breaks down how interest rates work, what affects them, and how they shape your investment decisions with charts, tables, and linked data sources you can use for your own analysis.

## The Base Rate

The foundation of the U.S. interest-rate system is the Federal Reserve ("the Fed"). The Fed uses <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">open market operations and other tools</a> to influence the level of money in the U.S. economy. It does this primarily by buying and selling U.S. Treasury securities.

<Note>
  Changes in bank reserve balances affect the federal funds rate, the interest
  rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans on excess reserves.
</Note>

Changes in the federal funds rate usually trigger a chain of events that affect other short-term interest rates, foreign exchange rates, long-term interest rates, the amount of money and credit, and, ultimately, a range of economic variables, including employment, output, and prices of goods and services.

The Fed's actions impact liquidity in the banking system.

When the Fed:

- Buys Treasuries (adds liquidity), rates fall
- Sells Treasuries (removes liquidity), rates rise

Short-term Treasury yields follow closely, influencing mortgage rates, loan rates, corporate borrowing, and more.
