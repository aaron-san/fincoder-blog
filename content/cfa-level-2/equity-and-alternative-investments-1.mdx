## Income Property Analysis and Appraisal

### Capitalization Rate

<Math>{"Cap rate = r$_{NOI}$ - g$_{NOI}$"}</Math>

### Measuring the Cap Rate

1. Market Extraction Method (ME)
2. Band-of-Investment Method (BOI)
3. Built-Up Method (BU)

4. Built-Up Method (BU)

- The built-up method depends on macroeconomic factors, and is generally used when comparables are not present. The built-up method doesn't consider the method of financing.

<Math>
  {"C$_{0}$ = pure rate + liquidity premium + recapture premium + risk premium"}
</Math>

2. Band-of-Invesment Method (BOI)
   The BOI utilizes a WACC as an estimate of the market capitalization rate. It is appropriate for properties that utilize both debt and equity financing. In the BOI method, we adjust the capitalization rate by adding a sinking fund factor.

### Sinking Fund Factor

<Math>{"SFF = PMT(i/12, n $\\times$ 12, PV = 0, FV = -1)"}</Math>

### Annual Mortgage Cost = annual YTM + SFF (%)

<Math>
  {
    "C$_0$ = WACC = (mortgage weight x mortgage cost) + (equity weight x equity cost)"
  }
</Math>

### Equity Reversion After Taxes (ERAT)

<Math>{"ERAT = Net selling price - Mortgage balance - Taxes"}</Math>

## Recaptured Depreciation

- Recaptured depreciation represents depreciation that was taken in anticipation of a decline in the value of an asset that ultimately did not materialize.
- Recaptured depreciation = Accumulated depreciation (A/D)
- Tax on recaptured depreciation = Accumulated depreciaiton _ tax on recaptured depreciation
  Tax on capital gains = tax rate on capital gains _ (capital gain - recaptured depreciation)

## Private Equity Valuation

Definitions
Portfolio Company - companies that private equity firms invest in
Private Equity Firm - companies that create portfolios of portfolio companies and allow PE investors to invest in
Private Equity Investor - outside investors who makes an investment in a fund offered by the PE firm

### Unique Sources of Value for Private Equity Investments

1. Ability to re-engineer the firm for efficiency
2. Ability to acquire debt at favorable terms
3. Superior alignment of interests between managers and owners

#### Definitions

- Compensation - payment that is closely linked to the firm's performance
- Tag-Along, Drag-Along Clauses - the requirement that an acquiring firm extend the acquisition offer to all shareholders, including firm management
- Board Representation - The private equity firm is ensured control through board representation in a major event
  Noncompete Clauses - Company founders must sign a clause that prevents them from competing against the firm withina prespecified period of time

### Priority in Claims

- Private equity firms receive their distributions before other owners

### Required Approvals

- Changes of strategic importance must be approved by the private equity firm

### Earn-Outs

- These tie the acquisition price paid by the private equity firm to the portfolio company's future performance over a specified time period.

## Adjustments for Probability of Failure

1. If the probability of failure in any given year is expected to remain constant, use...

<Math>
  {
    "r$_{adj}$ = $\\frac{\\normalsize {1 + r_{unadj}}}{\\normalsize {1 - Pr(failure)}} - 1$"
  }
</Math>

2. If the probability of failure in any given year is expected to change each year, adjust each year's expected cash flows to reflect the Probability of failure ($0 cash flow, Pr(failure)) or adjust the expected exit value.
