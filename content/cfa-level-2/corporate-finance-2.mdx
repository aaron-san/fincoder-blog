## Capital Budgeting (cont.)

### Sensitivity analysis

- Analyze the model's sensitivity to key variables
- Analyze best/worst scenarios
- Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Randomize many scenarios
  - Generate probability distribution for NPV and IRR

### Capital Rationing

- Hard capital rationing: the maximum capital budget cannot be exceeded
- Soft capital rationing: the maximum capital budget is regarded as flexible
- Budget constraints set by managers
- Goal is to optimize NPV within the capital budget

### Project Cost of Capital (Discount rate)

- Can use the Securities Market Line (SML) to calculate required return on equity
- The cost of debt is the yield to maturity on existing debt or new debt issuance
- Weighted-average cost of capital is the weighted average of cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt
- WACC should reflect risk of project, not risk of company (which is a basket of projects), but can use WACC if project has similar risk to overall firm
- Discount nominal expected future cash flows at the nominal required return; discount real expected future cash flows at the real required return


<Math>{"$R_{eq} = R_{rf} + \\beta_{project}(R_m - R_{rf})$"}</Math>

###
- For dividend paying firms, can use the Dividend Discount Model (Gordon Growth Model)
<Math>
  {
    "$R_{eq} = \\frac{D_1}{P_0} + g$"
  }
</Math>


<Math>
  {
    "$R_{debt} = YTM$"
  }
</Math>

<Math>
  {
    "$WACC = \\frac{E}{V}R_{eq} + \\frac{D}{V}R_{debt}(1-T)$"
  }
</Math>

### Factors management considers when setting their minimum rate of return.

1. Risk level of the division's business
2. Interest rates on the company's debt
3. Investors' expectations
4. Competitors' rate of return
5. Return being serviced by other divisions
6. General economic conditions

- Once a firm has established a desirable target capital structure, it should make financing decisions that are consistent with that target structure
- The return that investors want to earn on a project is the same as the one they would get form an alternative investment with the same risk characteristics
- Lender's set interest rates (costs of debt) to reflect a firm's ability to pay debt costs that reflect the earning ability of the firm's total assets, not just the project's assets, as a guarantee of principal and interest repayment
- Each project has its own cost of capital, and the firm's cost of capital is simply the weighted average of the capital costs of the various projects that the firm has undertaken
- Projects that offer diversification benefits to the overall firm have effects that are irrelevant to shareholders, because shareholders can easily diversify their portfolios without the help of managers by buying shares of other stock

### Investment Opportunity Set (IOS)

<img src="/images/cfa1-investment-opportunity-set.svg" />

- Assumptions
  - Project risk is held constant
  - Capital Structure is held constant

### Pure-Play Method: Project Cost of Capital

- Step 1: Estimate the project's relative proportions of debt (D) and equity (E) financing:
  - Use the average of the proxies' capital structure (D/A and E/A), since the proxies are expected to operate in similar lines of business, with the same risk, and whose investors are likely to require a similar degree of financial leverage.
  - MV Equity = Share Price \* No. shares outstanding
  - MV Debt = PV of coupons and principal
- Step 2: Estimate the project's after-tax cost of debt (kd(1-tc)):
  - Use the average of the proxies' borrowing rates
  - Use the firm's marginal tax rate
- Step 3: Estimate the project's cost of equity: ke
  - Unlever the proxies' equity beta to get the average proxy's asset beta
  - Relever the average of the proxies' asset beta at the project's target D/E value to get the project's equity beta
  - Use the CAPM
  - Rf is the rate on government bonds
  - MRP is 5% (historical average)
- Step 4: Calculate the project's WACC

### Real Options

- The right to do something without an obligation to do it (related to capital budgeting projects)

### Real Options Analysis

- Calculate NPV without real option
- If NPV > 0, no need to estimate the real option value, otherwise consider the value of the real option

### Capital Budgeting Mistakes and Dangers

- Failure to account for economic responses
- Misusing standardized templates
- Pet projects of senior managers
- Using EPS or ROE to decide investment choice
- Using IRR when it conflicts with NPV
- Poor cash flow, overhead cost, discount rate estimations
- Politics of spending entire capital budget
- Failure to generate alternative investment ideas
- Incorrect use of opportunity and sunk costs
