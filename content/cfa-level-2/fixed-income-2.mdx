## Credit Analysis (cont.)

### Single Monthly Mortality Rate (SMM)

- CMBS typically have some form of loan-level prepayment protection, while residential MBS do not.
- CMBS mortgages are structured as non-recourse.
- Mortgage-backed securities, which triggered the financial collapse, were priced using the Gaussian copula model.

### Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBSs)

- Securities that are secured by pools of mortgage loans that provide collateral and cash flow backing

- Examples: mortgage passthrough securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, stripped mortgage-backed securities
- Some GSE's; namely, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac; purchase mortgages from private lenders to provide funds, that would not otherwise be provided privately, for mortgage loans.

### Commercial MBSs
- Backed by a pool of commercial mortgage loans on income producing property
- Non-recourse loans (unlike residential MBS), so each property must be assessed in isolation rather than as a pool

#### Debt-to-Service Coverage (DSC)
<Math>
{"$Debt to service coverage (DSC) = $"}
</Math>
### Mortgage Securitization

- Process of combining similar debt obligations as collateral for new securities
- Increases the debt's attractiveness to investors
- Increases the availability of funds for home mortgages

### Mortgage Pass-through Security

- Passes the payments made on a pool of mortgages through proportionally to each security holder

### Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)

- Securities derived by reallocating the cash flows from mortgage-backed securities or pools of mortgage loans in order to create multiple classes, or tranches, of securities with coupon rates and average lives that differ from the underlying collateral as a whole
- Although CMO tranches can be structured (through the use of cash flow priority and "support" tranches) to give somewhat more predictable cash flows, the actual future cash flow and hence value of CMOs are subject to change
- Securities with specific rights that vary from that of MBSs (do not simply pass through a cash flow proportional to the percentage of ownership)
- Feature multiple "tranches" that feature varying risks and expected cash flows
- Permit the "redistribution of prepayment risk"
- Permits the "creation of securities with various maturity ranges"
- Created to appeal to a wider group of investors so that borrowing costs decline.
- A CMO is an alternative to mortgage loans and conventional mortgage-backed securities

### Stripped MBSs

- Either the principal-only (PO) or interest-only (IO) portions of a mortgage passthrough security

### Planned Amortization Class (PAC)

- A type of tranche that is characterized by a nearly fixed amortization schedule. It is designed to not be subject to prepayment risk.
- Some underlying mortgages are insured by the government, providing a credit guarantee in the case of borrower default, but does not provide insurance to tranche investors against changes in interest rates and subsequent prepayments.
- A major flaw in mortgage-backed security pricing was the underestimation of the correlation among residential assets. Few priced the securities to account for a potential cascading effect.

### Benefits of Structured (Securitized) Assets

1. Risk Transfer
2. Liquidity

A securitization is a self-liquidating aset pool that generates cash to repay the bonds that finance the assets' purchase from the bank that originated them.
Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs)

## Asset-Backed Sector of the Bond Market

### Asset-Backed Securities

#### Credit Enhancements

External:

1. Letters of Credit
2. Corporate Guarantees
3. Bond Insurance
   Internal:
4. Reserve Funds
5. Senior/Subordinated Structure
6. Over-collateralization
7. Excess servicing spread accounts

- Prepayment tranching is also referred to as time tranching. Prepayment tranching refers to when an asset or mortgage backed security is subdivided so some components are exposed to more prepayment risk than others.
- In an asset-backed security backed by non-amortizing assets (e.g. credit cards), the composition of loans in the pool will change. During the lockout period, principal payments are not distributed to bondholders. Instead, new loans are purchased and this structure is referred to as a revolving structure. However, the retirement of principal (i.e. a call provision) in a revolving structure can be triggered by several different events. These events include a specific date, when the collateral falls below a certain level, or when cumulative losses in the collateral reach a certain level.
- In an asset-backed security backed by amortizing assets (e.g. automobile loans), the composition of loans in the pool will not change. No new loans are purchased. A lockout period provision refers to an ABS backed by non-amortizing loans.
- Countries with efficient legal systems and common-law origin are more likely to have more long-term debt issues by low D/E ratio issuers.

### Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

- Congress created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide liquidity in the mortgage market by allowing these government sponsored enterprises to buy mortgage loans in the secondary market.
- In essence, FNMA and FHLMC subsidize the bulk of U.S. mortgages.
- FNMA and FHLMC have been the high priests of the religion of home-ownership.
- In 2008 the U.S. government took direct control of FNMA and FHLMC amid a housing price spiral and soaring mortgage defaults.

### Institutional Loans

- Loans mostly funded by investors instead of banks
- Covered Bonds
- Structured security that is backed by the repayments on a pool of loans, but unlike most asset-backed securities, covered bonds remain ona banks books and stands as a backer to the bonds

### Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)

- Structured assets that invest in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds and other asset-backed securities.
- Sliced into tranches carrying different risks which were sold to investors as bonds or equity.

### Synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligations

- A set of repackaged credit default swaps (protection against default on debt, rather than cash or loans)

* Gives investors exposure to the credit markets without having to buy the underlying assets
  - Risk Factors for Structured Securities
  1. Prepayment rates
  2. Default rates
  3. Loss severity

### Valuing Mortgage-Backed and Asset-Backed Securities

#### Cash Flow Yield

- The yield that equates the present value of a security with its market value and accrued interest (i.e. IRR for MBSs and ABSs)
- To determine a cash flow yield, some assumption about the prepayment rate must be made.
- The cash flow for MBS and ABSs is usually monthly.
- Bond-Equivalent Yield (for MBSs and ABSs)

<Math>{"BEY = 2 $\\times [(1+i_m)^6-1]$"}</Math>

### Yield Spreads

1. Nominal spread
2. Zero-Volatility Spread
3. Option-Adjusted Spread

- A trial-and-error procedure is required to determine the zero-volatility spread.

### Interest Rate Path-Dependency

- Prepayments (cash flows) are sometimes dependent on the path of interest rates, instead of just the current level of interest rate. Not all outstanding mortgages are underwritten at the current interest rate level; some were refinanced when interest rates were even lower than they appear today and there is little incentive to refinance, or prepay, today.
