## Mergers and Acquisitions

### Acquisition
- Acquirer buys only part part of a target company

### Merger
- Acquirer absorbs the whole target company

### Forms of Integration
- Statutory merger: target company ceases to exist
- Subsidiary merger: target company becomes a subsidiary of the acquirer
- Consolidation: aquirer and target form a completely new company

### Types of Mergers
- Backward integration: merge with supplier
- Forward integration: merge with customer
- Conglomerate: merge with ...
- Horizontal: merge with competitor

### Motivations for a Merger
- Synergies
- More rapid business growth
- Greater market power
- Gain access to new markets
- Diversification
- Bootstrapping
- Personal gains for managers
- Tax benefits
- Capture hidden value
- Achieve international business goas


### Statutory Merger
- It is ordinarily much more cost-effective for shareholders to diversify on their own
- Most acquisition problems assume that additional shares are issued to finance the acquisition

### Bootstrapping EPS
- A method to packages EPS of the acquirer and target
- The goal is to create higher EPS through acquisition
- A firm with high P/E (e.g., high growth) acquires a firm with low P/E (low growth)
- This sometimes leads to an increase in current EPS but lower future EPS
- Real economic gains are not necessarily achieved

### Stock Dilution
Theoretical Diluted Price = ((O x OP) +(N x IP)) / (O + N) where
O = original number of shares
OP = Current share price
N = number of new shares to be issued
IP = issue price of new shares

### Cash Payment
- The acquirer assumes the risk and receives the reward from the synergies present in the merger, while the gain to the target is limited to the takeover premium
Gains to Target = Cash Paid - Target's Pre-merger Market Capitalization
Gains to Acquirer = NPV of Synergies - Gains to Target

### Stock Payment
- The target assumes some of the risks and reward from the synergies present in the merger

1. Calculate number of new shares issued by acquirer and issued to target's shareholders
2. Calculate value of new firm = VA + VT + S - C … where C = 0, since no cash is paid
3. Divide new firm value by the new number of shares outstanding to get the value of the new firm's stock

Gains to Target = Value of new firm's stock\*Number of shares issued to target's shareholders - Target's Pre-merger Market Capitalization
Gains to Acquirer = NPV of Synergies - Gains to Target

### Winner's Curse
- The tendency of acquirers to overpay for target firms and results from a competitive bidding process

### Managerial Hubris
- The tendency of managers to overestimate the potential synergies of the merger

### Divestitures
- Selling, liquidating, or spinning off a division or subsidiary

### Equity Carveouts
1. New, independent company
2. New Shares, issued through formal, separate IPO
3. Separate and distinct management team

### Spin-Offs
1. New, independent company
2. New Shares, issued proportionately to shareholders of the parent firm
3. Separate and distinct management team

### Split-Offs
1. New, independent company
2. New Shares, exchanged for shares of the parent company
3. Separate and distinct management team

### Liquidations
- Separation and sale of a firm's assets, usually associated with bankruptcy

### Reasons for Divestitures

1. Division no longer first into management's long-term strategy
2. Lack of profitability
3. Individual parts are worth more than the whole - reverse synergy
4. Infusion of cash



### Valuing a Target Company

1. Discounted cash flow method

- Determine FCFF
- Determine discount rate (target company WACC adjusted for merger effects)
- Discount cash flows to present
- Determine terminal value (constant growth or market multiple)

- Advantages:

  - Easy to model changes in cash flows from synergies
  - Might avoid biases in current market data
  - Easy to customize

- Disadvantages:
  - Difficult to model when cash flows are negative
  - Estimation error of the terminal value
  - Can be highly sensitive to the discount rate

2. Comparable Company Analysis

- Look at similar firms that were aquired
- Add a takeover premium to target's value to determine fair price

- Advantages:
  - Easy access to data
  - Value estimates come from the market (lower estimation error)
- Disadvantages:
  - The market might be valueing comparable firms incorrectly
  - Must determine takeover premium separately
  - Difficult to incorporate synerges or changes in capital structures
  - Historical takeover premium data might be outdated

3. Comparables Transaction Analysis

- Look at values of recent takeover transactions, not just comparable firms
- No need to calculate separate takeover premium

- Advantages:

  - No need to estimate a takeover premium
  - Estimates of value are directly derived from recent deal prices

- Disadvantages:
  - Past M&A transactions might be mispriced
  - Possibly not enough comparable transaction data
  - Difficult to incorporate synergies or changing capital structures
  - Past M&A transactions might be mispriced
  - Possibly not enough comparable transaction data
  - Difficult to incorporate synergies or changing capital structures
