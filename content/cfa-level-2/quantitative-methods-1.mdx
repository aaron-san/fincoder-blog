## Covariance and Correlation

### Covariance
- A nonstandardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables that ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity
- Positive (+) covariance means the variables tend to move in the same direction and vice versa
- Calculated as the expected value of the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means
- Units are squared units of the variables being measured and are not standardized so are less meaningful

<Math>
  {
    "$Cov_{1,2} = E[(X_1 - \\mu_1)(Y_2 - \\mu_2)]$"
  }
  </Math>

  <Math>
{"$Cov_{1,2} = \\frac {\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}[(R_{t,1}-\\hat{R}_1((R_{t,1}-\\hat{R}_1))]}{n-1}$"}
  </Math>
  
### Correlation
- A standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables that ranges from -1 to +1
- Positive (+) correlation means the variables tend to move in the same direction and vice versa
- Calculated as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations
<Math>
  {
    "$\\rho_{1,2} = \\frac {Cov_{1,2}}{\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2}$"
  }
</Math>

#### Significance of Correlation Coefficient

- Null Hypothesis: ρ = 0 (no linear relationship between X and Y)
- Alternative Hypothesis: p not equal to 0 (there is a non-zero correlation with X% confidence level)
- Two-tailed test
- Degrees of freedom = n - 2

<Math>{"$t = \\frac{r\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1=r^2}}$"}</Math>

<Math>{"$t = \\sqrt{\\frac{r^2}{1-r^2}\\times(n-2)}$"}</Math>

#### Limitations to Correlation Analysis
- Outliers distort the correlations
- Spurious correlation (linear relationship without economic rationale)
- Nonlinear relationships cannot be captured with correlation
