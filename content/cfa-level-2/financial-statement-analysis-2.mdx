## Financial Statement Analysis (cont.)

### Financial Reporting Quality
1. Revenue Recognition
  - Percent (%) Completion method
  - Earnings activities complete
  - Assurance of recieipt
  - Bill and hold
  - Unearned income

2. Depreciation Assumptions
  - Straight-line vs. accelerated Methods
  - Expected useful life assumption
  - Salvage value assumption

3. Inventory Assumptions
- Inventory flow (FIFO, LIFO, AVCO)
- Normal cost
- Lower of cost or market rules

4. Goodwill
- Fair value measurement
- Impairments

5. Deferred Taxes
  - Valuation allowance

6. Pension Accounting
  - Discount rate
  - Expected returns
  - Salary growth
7. Assets Held at Fair Market Value (Illiquid Investments)
8. Stock Options
9. Provisions



### Accrual vs. Cash Accounting

#### Cash Accounting

- Transaction recorded upon receipt of cash
- No subjectivity and easy to verify

#### Accrual Accounting

- Revenue and expenses triggered by earnings process
- **Advantage**: Timely and relevant information with indication of value creating activities
- **Disadvantage**: Subjective measurement and earnings management

### Earnings
- Quality = persistence and sustainability
- Mean reversion
- Cash flow and accruals elements
- **Advantage**: Accruals element is not sustainable (Accruals naturally self correct)
- **Disadvantage**: Cash earnings don't always reflect earned revenues and can be used to manipulate earnings

<Math>
{"$Net Operating Assets (NOA) = (Total Assets - Cash) - (Total Liabilities - Total Debt)$"}
</Math>

#### Manipulation Incentives
  - Analyst expectations
  - Remuneration (bonuses and stock options)
  - Debt covenants
  - Financing (raising further funds)

### Disciplining Mechanisms
- External auditors
- Internal audit/committee
- Management certification
- Class action lawsuits
- Regulators
- Market scrutiny

<Math>
{"Aggregate accruals = Accrual-based earnings $-$ Cash-based earnings"}
</Math>

<Math>
{"Aggregate accruals (balance sheet) = NOA$_t -$ NOA$_{\\text{t-1}}$"}
</Math>

<Math>
{"Aggregate accruals (cash flows) = Net income $-$ (CFO$_t$ + CFI$_t$)"}
</Math>

### Earnings Management

#### Revenue Recognition Problems

##### Range of problems

  - Recognition of sale before completion of earnings process
  - Recognition of sale without assurance of receipt

##### Estimates
  - Credit sales
  - Deferred/Unearned revenue
  - Warranty provisions
  - Sales returns

##### Warning Signs
- Large increase in accounts receivable
- Large drop in unearned revenue
- Lower future cash flows and accounting rates of return

#### Accelerating Revenue Recognition

##### Range of problems:
  - Recognition of sale before completion of earnings process
  - Lowering credit standards
  - Cut-off issues (moving the sales between periods)

##### Warning Signs
- Bundled products
- Management vested options ITM
- Pressure to meet earnings forecasts
- Raising additional finance
- Large rise in accounts receivables
- Large drop in unearned revenue
- Dispraportionate revenue in last quarter

#### Recognizing Revenue Too Early
- Bill-and-hold sales
- Lessor use of sales type vs. direct financing leases
- Recording sales prior to acceptance by customer (e.g., sales of equipment prior to installation)
- Incorrectly using Percent-Completion Method for long-term contracts
