## Financial Statement Analysis

### Inventories

#### FIFO vs LIFO

- In a period of rising prices, FIFO produces higher net income and higher ending inventory value
- In a period of rising prices, LIFO produces lower net income and lower ending inventory value
- LIFO conformity rule requires that if a company uses LIFO for tax purposes, it must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes
- LIFO liquidation occurs when a company using LIFO sells more inventory than it purchases during a period, resulting in older, lower-cost inventory being used to calculate COGS, which increases net income and taxes

#### Lower of Cost or Market (LCM)

- Inventory is reported at the lower of its historical cost or its market value (replacement cost)
- U.S. GAAP requires LCM for LIFO and retail inventory methods; IFRS requires lower of cost or net realizable value for all methods
- IAS: subsequent reversal permitted
- U.S. GAAP: subsequent reversal prohibited

##### Cost

- Normal cost of getting inventory into current condition and location
- Excludes: abnormal amounts, storage costs, selling costs, admin overheads

##### Net Realizable Value (NRV)

<table style={{ width: "300px", border: "none" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "70%" }}>NRV</th>
      <th style={{ width: "30%" }}>$</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Estimated selling price</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

### Long-Lived Assets

- Depreciation Methods

  - Straight-Line: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
  - Double Declining Balance: 2 / Useful Life x Book Value at Beginning of Year
  - Units of Production: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Estimated Production x Actual Production

### Equity Accounting

- Used when investor has significant influence (20-50% ownership)
- Indicators:
  - Board representation
  - Participation in policy decisions
  - Material transactions
  - Interchange of managerial personnel
  - Dependence on technology/intellectual property

- Initial investment recorded at cost and includes directly attributable transaction costs

- Investor's share of investee's earnings increases the investment account; dividends decrease it

- In subsequent periods:
  - Balance sheet: Cost + earnings/losses - dividends
  - Change in Balance Sheet: %Share \* Change in retained earnings
  - Income Statement: Earnings gain/loss (%share of NI)
  - FMV adjustments impact future earnings

    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "70%" }}>Breakdown of Purchase price (cost)</th>
      <th style={{ width: "30%" }}>$</th>

    <tr>
      <td>% Net assets aquired</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>% FMV adjustments</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Goodwill</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cost paid</td>
      <td style={{borderTop: "1px solid gray", textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

#### Impairments
- IFRS: Carrying value > Recoverable amoount (where Recoverable amount = higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal)
- U.S. GAAP: Carrying value > Fair value (considered permanent)
- No reversals allowed
- Goodwill not separately tested

### Fair Value Accounting

- Can elect to hold investment at fair value with changes in fair value taken to the income statement
