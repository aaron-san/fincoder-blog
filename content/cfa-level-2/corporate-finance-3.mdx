## Capital Structure

- Firms using debt financing must generate sufficient income from operations to claim the interest deductions 
- A firm that does not pay income taxes and does not expect to become a taxpayer has less incentive to incur additional debt
- A firm can carry tax losses forward
- Additional Debt is beneficial when…
  - Expected PV(tax shields) > Expected PV(costs of financial distress) + Expected PV(increase in agency costs)
- A firm's capital structure should probably contain no more debt than its future tax position will let it use. For example, firms in industries with other substantial tax shelter opportunities should have lower leverage ratios than firms in other industries.

### MM Proposition I (No Taxes): Capital Structure Irrelevance Proposition
- Assumptions
  1. Capital markets are perfectly competitive
  2. Investors have homogenous expectations
  3. Riskless borrowing and lending
  4. Agency costs
  5. Investment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions
  VL = VU
  
### MM Proposition II (No Taxes): Cost of Equity and Leverage Proposition
- The cost of equity increases linearly as a company increases its proportion of debt financing
  <Math>{"$r_e = r_0 + \\frac{D}{E}(r_0 - r_d)$"}</Math>
  As leverage increases, the cost of equity increases, but WACC and the cost of debt are unchanged.
  MM Proposition I (With Taxes): Value is Maximized at 100% Debt
  VL = VU + (t\*Debt)

### MM Proposition II (With Taxes): WACC is Minimized at 100% Debt
  
  <Math>{"$r_e = r_0 + \\frac{D}{E}(r_0 - r_d)(1-t)$"}</Math>
  
#### Cost of Financial Distress (expected)
1. Cost of financial distress and bankruptcy - bankruptcy, legal fees, lost trust of customers, foregone investment opportunities
2. Probability of financial distress - operating and financial leverage, and management expertise

#### Agency Costs of Equity
1. Monitoring Costs - supervision of management, corporate governance administration costs
2. Bonding Costs - insurance costs for management performance, implied costs of non-compete agreements
3. Residual Losses - all other costs
  
#### Costs of Assymetric Information 
- higher required returns on debt and equity capital
  
#### Signaling
- Acquiring debt tells investors that a firm is confident in its ability to make future interest payments
- Issuing equity tells investors that managers think their firm's stock is undervalued
- The cost of assymetric information increases as the proportion of equity in the capital structure increases

#### Pecking Order Theory
- Managers prefer to make financing choices that are least likely to send signals to investors

#### Preferred Financing Hierarchy

1. Retained Earnings (internal financing)
2. Debt
3. External Equity (newly issued shares)

### Static Trade-Off Theory
- There is a balance between the costs of financial distress and the tax shield benefits from using debt
<Math>{"$V_L = V_U + (t*Debt) - PV(costs of financial distress)$"}</Math>

###
- The optimal proportion of debt is reached at the point when the marginal benefit provided by the tax shield of taking on additional debt is equal to the marginal costs of financial distress incurred from the additional debt

### Fluctuation of Capital Structure Around its Target
1. Management may choose to exploit opportunities ina specific financing source
2. Market value fluctuations will occur
###
- Companies in developed countries tend to use more debt with longer maturities than firms in emerging markets
- In presenting the "Law of the Conservation of Investment Value" (The Theory of Investment Value, pg. 72), John Burr Williams argued that since the value of an enterprise is the "present worth" of all its future distributions - whether interest or dividends - it "in no [way] depends on what the company’s capitalization is".

### Effect of Personal Taxes

### Business Risk
- The volatility of cash flows and earnings that arise from the particular business firm in which a firm operates

### Financial Risk
- The magnification of EPS arising from the use of debt (leverage)

### Dilution Effect
- Fresh equity, supplied by new investors, reduces the percentage of the firm's equity capital controlled by the original owners

### Capital Structure Effects
- The value of the firm's (not project's) expected future operating cash flows are the basis for lending and investing decisions.

There are 2 cases where it is important to adjust explicitly for capital structure effects:
1. When the repayment of a loan is tied to one or more specifi assets (use APV)
2. When firms adjust their capital structures to conicide with their target capital structures

### Adjusted Present Value (APV)
- Adjusted Present Value is used to account for financing side-effects in special situations where the financing is based on the asset's capital structure (not the firm's)
1. Base-case NPV
2. Financing side-effects
APV = Base-case NPV + Financing Side-effects
VL = VU + T*D = ATCF/r + T*rd*D/rd
…Implies that…
WACC = r(1-T*L) L = leverage ratio???

### Leveraged Buyouts
- Leveraged Buyouts involves and asset-specific capital structure. - By design, the leverage will decrease over time. 
- Cash flows from asset sales and operations are dedicated to repay debt. 
- The owners of the firm intend to restore its capital structure to one that is more normal, typically within 5 to 7 years.
Firms normally treat their preferred stock payment obligations as though they were fixed. If a firm issues a significant amount of preferred stock particularly if it contains a sinking fund, these payment obligations can impair the credit standing of the firm's debt securities.
The rating agencies give greater equity weight to preferred stock the longer its remaining maturity. Mandatory convertibles (into common stock) are given more equity weight than standard convertibles, which are given more weight than nonconvertible preferred stock.

### Changing Capital Structure
- Two ways to change capital structure:
1. A firm can alter its capital structure slowly by adjusting its future financing mix appropriately.
2. The firm could change its capital structure quickly through one of the following:
    a. Exchange offer
    b. Recapitalization offer
    c. Debt or share repurchase
    d. Stock for debt swap

- Changing a capital structure can elicit high transaction costs and signaling effects (positive and negative).
- If the distance of a firm's capital structure from its target corresponds to at least one full rating category, some type of one-time transactions to make an immediate change in capital structure is probably warranted. A leverage increase for a significantly underleveraged firm is likely to increase the firm's share price. If the firm is less than one full category away from its rating objective, altering its retention ratio and its external financing mix is probably more cost effective.
- Determining an Optimal Capital Structure
1. Ability to service debt
2. Ability to use interest tax shields fully
3. Ability of assets to support det (protection against illiquidity)
4. Desired degree of access to capital markets
5. Dynamic factors and debt management over time
