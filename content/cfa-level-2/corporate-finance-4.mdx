## Dividends and Share Repurchases

Dividend Irrelevance
Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (MM) maintain that dividend policy is irrelevent.
→If dividends are too small, simply sell some of the stock to make homemade dividends.
→If dividends are too high, simply reinvest dividends into more shares of the stock.
Bird-in-Hand Argument for Dividend Policy
Myron Gordon and John Lintner argue that investors place a higher value on current dividends than expected capital gains.
(i.e. the dividend yield component of total return, D1/P0 has less risk than the growth component, g)
A company that initiates a new dividend policy will reduce the required rate of return on its equity, increasing the value of its equity
Tax Aversion
Different tax rates on capital gains and dividend income can influence investors' preferences.
Share Repurchase
A transaction in which a company buys back shares of its own stock with cash
The cash nature of share repurchase is considered similar to a cash dividend, and therefore a close substitute to a cash dividend
Rationales for Share Repurchases
(1) Potential Tax Advantages (differential tax rates on capital gains and dividends)
(2) Share Price Support/Signaling (management signals to investors that its stock is udervalued)
(3) Added Flexibility (unlike dividends, share repurchases are not a long-term commitment)
(4) Offsetting Dilution from Employee Stock Options (repurchases offset EPS dilution caused from the exercise of employee stock options)
(5) Increasing Financial Leverage (share repurchases reduce equity (increase leverage))
Stable Dividend Policy
Focuses on a stable dividend payout, even though earnings may be unstable
Companies look at long-term expected earnings to determine their stable dividend policy
Target Payout Adjustment Model
If Current Payout Ratio < Target Payout Ratio
Expected Dividend = Previous Dividend + (Expected increase in EPS)*(Target Payout Ratio)\*(Adjustment Factor)
…where Adjustment Factor = 1/(number of years over which the adjustment in dividends will take place)
