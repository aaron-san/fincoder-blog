## Corporate Governance
- Corporate governance is the system of principles, policies, procedures, and clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities used to manage an organization
- Objectives:
  1. Reduce conflicts of interest
  2. Align management and shareholder interests
  3. Ensure proper oversight of management by the board of directors
  4. Proper use of the company's assets

- Strong corporate governance reduces agency costs and the risk of corporate scandals, fraud, and potential civil and criminal liability of the firm and its directors


### Effective Corporate Governance Structures
1. Define the rights of shareholders and other important stakeholders
2. Clearly identify manager and director governance responsibilities to stakeholders
3. Provide clear and measurable accountability for managers and directors in assuming their responsibilities
4. Provide for fair and equitable treatment in all dealings between managers, directors, and shareholders
5. Have complete transparency and accuracy in disclosures regarding operations, performance, risk, and financial position

### Inherent Risks
#### Managers and Shareholders (Owners)
- Managers may act in self-interest rather than in the best interest of shareholders
- Examples:
  - Using funds to expand size of firm
  - Giving excessive compensation and perquisites
  - Investing in risky ventures
  - Avoiding risk

#### Directors and Shareholders
- Directors may align more closely with managers than shareholders
- Examples:
  - Lack of independence
  - Personal relationships with managers
  - Having consulting business agreements with the firm
  - Interlinked boards
  - Directors are overcompensated
