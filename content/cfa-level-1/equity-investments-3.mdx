## Market Anamolies (public information - tests for Semi-strong EMH)

- Black suggests that most anomalies result from "data mining"

### Earnings surprises

- Quarterly earnings surprises are not priced as fast as semistrong EMH would suggest

### Calendar studies

Unexpected returns are observed in January, beginning of week, end of weeks, etc.

### Price-earnings (P/E) ratio

- Stock with low P/E ratios have experienced above-market returns, while stock with high P/E ratios have experienced below-market returns

### Small firm effect

- Small firms consistently earned higher risk-adjusted returns than large firms, maybe due to inability of CAPM to correctly capture small-firm risk

### Neglected firms effect

- Companies with few analysts following them appear to have above-average returns

### Book value/Market value ratios

- The greater the BV/MV ratio, the higher the risk-adjusted rate of return

## Reasons Why Markets Should be Efficient

- Large number of independent, profit-maximizing investors engaged in valuation
- New information comes to the market randomly
- Traders will adjust prices rapidly

## EMH Conclusions

### Weak-form efficiency

- Empirical evidence supports the Weak-form EMH - Simple trading rules using historical price and volume data cannot be used to consistently produce superior returns after adjusting for transaction costs and taxes

### Semi-strong form efficiency

- Empirical evidence mostly supports the Semi-strong EMH
- Event studies support and time-series and Cross-sectional studies contradict Semi-strong form EMH

### Strong-form efficiency

- Empirical evidence does not support the Strong-form EMH
- Corporate insiders and market specialists have superior inside information and can consistently earn abnormal profits
- The EMH predicts that most fundamental analysis is futile
- Only analysts with unique insight receive superior returns

## Role of Portfolio Managers (in a perfectly efficient market)

1.  Identify risk/return objectives
2.  Develop a well-diversified portfolio
3.  Reduce transaction costs
4.  Develop capital market expectations
5.  Implement and update investment strategy

<Note>
  The proper way to guage manager performance is to compare portfolio return to
  the return on a randomly selected buy-and-hold strategy of stocks within the
  same risk class.
</Note>
<Note>
  When the dividend yield (D/P, payout ratio) and the bond default spread are
  high, risk is generally high and investors expect or require a high return on
  stocks and bonds
</Note>

## Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

- An ETF is simply a basket of securities that are publicly traded in the marketplace.
- An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a type of closed-end mutual fund that pools assets in order to meet certain identified objectives, often matching the return of a particular index (e.g., S&P 500 Index, Russell 2000 Index, or an index representing a sector, such as gold or oil). Unlike a conventional, or open-end, mutual fund, ETFs trade throughout the day, with market arbitrage providing some level of confidence that the value of the ETF over time will track the performance of the relevant index.
- Throughout the day, there is an "INAV," or intra-day net-asset-value, which tracks the value of an ETF on a 15-second basis and is based on the underlying constituents.
- Because INAV values can have issues, market makers and ETF sponsors maintain a separate, real-time price on their ETF.
- The real driver of liquidity in an ETF is the liquidity of the underlying assets that the ETF holds.
- Market makers, specifically authorized participants (APs), can arbitrage differences between the net-asset-value (NAV) of an ETF and the value of the underlying ETF holdings.
- At every given point in the day, an AP is calculating the cost to buy the basket of securities that form an ETF, and the cost of selling a basket of securities that form an ETF. They compare these two "theoretical" portfolios to the live net asset value of the ETF.
- The market maker can simply redeem an ETF unit - If market makers or APs are "surprised" by a large incoming trade order, they may think an arbitrageur is trying to get the best of them, and that perhaps something is wrong with a stock in the basket or with their own internal NAV calculations of which they are not yet aware, and reflexively widen the spread.

## Issuing ETFs

- SEC approval is required to issue ETFs, which takes many months, sometimes years
- Alternatives to new SEC approval
  - Manage a portfolio of a company that already has SEC issuance clearance
  - Buy company with ETF issuance clearance
