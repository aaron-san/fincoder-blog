## Markets

### Call Market

- A market in which all bids and asks are gathered and the stock is traded at a single price that attempts to satisfy most of the orders ("clears the market")

### Continuous Market

- A market in which stocks are traded at any time the market is open

<Note>Stocks are priced either by auction or by dealers</Note>

## Short Selling

### Benefits of short selling

- Price Discovery
- Liquidity
- Short sellers discover many financial frauds

<Note>
  Stocks with more shorting activity tend to have poor investment fundamentals,
  such as low cash flow, earnings, and book value relative to price. Research
  suggests that short sellers distinguish between stocks with temporarily poor
  fundamentals and those with persistently poor fundamentals, indicating they
  influence prices accurately, on average.
</Note>

## Indexes/Indices

### Constructing an Index

1.  Sample
2.  Weighting sample members
3.  Computational procedure

### Price-Weighted Index

- Simple average of component prices with divisor that is adjusted for stock splits and changes in index stock representation
- A portfolio with equal number of shares of each stock in a price-weighted index will match the performance of the index assuming there are no stock splits, stock dividends or changes to the structure of the index.

### Market-Weighted Index

- Capitalization-weighted index value

<Math>{"x = $\\frac {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$"}</Math>

<Caution>Caution: Index returns typically focus on capital gains only!</Caution>

## Efficient Market Hypothesis

### Weak form Efficiency

- Prices reflect all currently available market information (historical sequence of prices, rates of return, trading volume data, etc.)

### Semi-strong form Efficiency

- Prices reflect all public market and non-market information

### Strong form Efficiency

- Price reflect all public and private market and non-market information ("perfect markets")

## Abnormal rate of return

<Math>
  {"Abnormal return = Actual return - expected, risk-adjusted rate of return"}
</Math>

## Tests for Market Efficiency

- Efficiency means informationally efficient, not operationally efficient.

### Weak-form Efficiency (threatens technical analysis)

- Test for ability to use historical price and volume information to earn abnormal returns (autocorrelation tests: ++---++++---)

## Tests for independence

- Trading rule tests - Semi-Strong form Efficiency (threatens fundamental analysis) Test for ability to use public market and non-market information to earn abnormal returns (Abnormal returns should add to zero in long run)

## Return prediction studies

### Event studies

- Time-series tests
- Cross-sectional tests (Security market line)

## Strong-form Efficiency

- Inside traders appear to earn above-average profits
- Specialists, with sole access to the limit order book, appear to earn above-average profits
- Security analysts, as reported in Value Line and the WSJ, strongly influence prices within 2 days
- Professional money managers underperform a buy-and-hold policy, after considering management fees and trading costs
