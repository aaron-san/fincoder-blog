## Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly						
						
### Monopolistic Competition						
- A market in which there are many similar, but slightly differentiated products which are close substitutes.						
Each firm faces a downward sloping demand curve that shifts downward in the long-run until Price equals ATC (economic profit = 0)						
						
### Oligopoly						
- A market in which there are a few interdependent firms with significant barriers to entry (due to economies of scale)						
- Oligopolistic firms sometimes form cartels in which they agree to restrict production and raise prices						
						
## Factors of Production						
						
### Derived Demand						
- Demand for a factor of production driven by the demand for a product						
- Demand for factors of production are derived demands						
						
### Monopsony						
A market in which there is a single buyer						
e.g. auto manufacturer as the single employer (buyer of labor)						
						
### Factors of Production						
1. Land						
2. Labor						
3. Capital						
4. Entrepreneurship						
						
### Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)						
- The additional revenue from an additional unit of the factor of production						
- The marginal revenue product curve is the firm's short-run demand curve for the productive input						
- A firm will use more units of input until the input's marginal revenue product is equal to market price						
						
- The demand for labor depends on the marginal revenue product of labor						
- The supply of labor faces two contradictory forces - (substitution effect) and (income effect).						
- The quantity of labor increases as the wage rate increase but eventually bends backwords as workers value leisure more than work (income effect).						
						
						
At the level of labor input where marginal product is greatest, marginal cost is at its minimum. Marginal cost then increases as more labor input is added. Up to the point where average product is greatest, average variable cost decreases as labor input increases.						
						
Industries that are labor intensive will be more sensitive to the wage rate and will adjust employment more for a given change in the wage rate.						
						
Labor responds to real wages, net of inflation and payroll taxes						
						
Renewable (re-useable)Natural Resource						
Supply of renewable resources is fixed (perfectly in-elastic)						
Supply is called "known stock"						
Example: land						
						
Non-renewable Natural Resource						
Supply is pefectly elastic at a price that equals the present value of its future price						
Hotelling principle: If resource prices are expected to increase by less than the risk-free rate, suppliers will increase current production and invest proceeds at the risk-free rate						
						
Example: oil						
						
Historical Funding Sources for Private Business in U.S.						
1.) Loans (60%)						
2.) Bonds (30%)						
3.) Equities (2%)						
						
Opportunity Cost						
The amount necessary to bid a factor of production away from its next-highest-valued alternative use						
						
Economic Rent						
The income above the opportunity cost of capital earned by an owner of a factor of production						
						
Aggregate Supply (AS)						
Short-run Aggregate Supply (SAS)						
Workers' wage demands are constant						
Increase in expected future inflation increases higher wage demands, Marginal Cost of production increases, and short-run aggregate supply shifts leftward.						
						
						
Long-run Aggregate Supply (LAS)						
Expected inflation equals actual inflation						
Full employment (zero cyclical unemployment)						
Potential real output (GDP) of economy						
						
Determinants of Aggregate Supply (LAS)						
Quantity of labor						
Quantity of capital						
Technology						
						
Aggregate Demand (AD)						
Aggregate Expenditures (AE) = C+I+G+NX						
Aggregate Demand (AD) = relationship between aggregate expenditures (AE = C+I+G+NX) and the price level (P)						
Prices increase → Interest rates increase: When the price level rises, individuals and businesses have less real money and must borrow, therefore the demand for loanable funds increases, thereby increasing the interest rate.						
						
Wealth effect - At higher price levels,  individuals and businesses have less wealth and therefore begin to spend less						
Substitution effect - At higher price levels, the demand for loanable funds increases as individuals need more to maintain real spending levels, causing an increase in interest rates.  Consequently, higher interest rates reduce current spending as individuals and  businesses save at higher opportunity costs of spending (saving is more valuable than spending)						
						
						
						
Shifts in Aggregrate Demand Curve						
Shifts in expectations about inflation, income and future profits						
Monetary and Fiscal policy						
World economy						
						
Types of Unemployment						
Frictional Unemployment (permanent) - unemployment arrising from normal turnover - entering and leaving the labor force and from ongoing cration and destruction of jobs.						
						
Structural Unemployment (long-term) - unemployment caused by changes in technology that force workers to improve skills.						
Cyclical Unemployment - unemployment caused by the business cycle.						
						
Full Employment						
Situation when there is no cyclical unemployment						
Produces the natural unemployment rate						
						
Potential GDP						
GDP output at full employment						
						
Business Cycle						
Growth, inflation, and business cycles arise from the relentless increases in potential GDP, faster (on the average) increases in aggregate demand, and fluctuations in the pace of aggregate demand growth						
						
						
The cyclical nature of Real GDP around potential GDP that is caused by the stickiness of money wage rates and its tendency to adjust slower than the price level						
						
						
An increase in the quantity of money at full employment will reduce interest rates in the short run, which would increase short-run aggregate demand above full employment. This causes wage demands to increase, which in turn reduces short-run aggregate suply. In the long run, real GDP reverts to its full-employment level with an increase in price level equal to the percentage increase in the quantity of money.						
						
						
						
Workers lose the buying power of their wages and demand more from their employers, causing an increase in each firm's Marginal Cost curve and a leftward shift in the Short-run aggregate supply curve, which further increases the price level, but brings GDP back to its long-term equilibrium level (potential GDP - GDP with zero cyclical unemployment)						
						
						
						
The economy "overheats" if the real GDP grows much faster than the money wage rate, requiring a sharp correction as workers demand more wages and real output raises prices and reduces output to accomadate the higher wage costs.						
						
						
Stagflation (recession and inflation) occurs when short-run aggregate supply decreases, causing higher prices and less output (GDP)						
						
Deflation						
A persistent decline in prices.  Consumers respond by delaying consumption which reduces Aggregate Demand and Real GDP.						
						
Mainstream Business Cycle Theory						
Cause of business cycle is due to variations in the growth of Aggregate Demand						
Potential GDP grows at a steady rate						
Money wage rate is sticky						
						
Real Business Cycle Theory (newest)						
The real business cycle is caused by changes in technology that bring fluctuations in the growth rate of Productivity						
Changes in technology will affect:						
1.) Investment demand						
2.) Demand for labor						
						
GDP Gap						
GDP Gap = Potential GDP - Real GDP						
Recessionary Gap:      Real GDP < potential GDP						
Inflationary Gap:         Real GDP > potential GDP						
						
Short-Run Phillips Curve						
Inflation and unemployment curve						
Holds expected inflation and natural unemployment rate constant						
A decrease in expected inflation shifts short-run Phillips curve down						
If inflation rises above its expected rate, unemployment falls below its natural rate						
						
Long-Run Phillips Curve						
Vertical line at the natural unemployment rate						
An increase in the natural unemployment rate shifts LRPC and SRPC rightward						
						
Macroeconomic Schools of Thought						
						
Classical						
Economy is self-regulating and always at full employment						
Technological change is most significant influence on AggDem and AggSupp						
						
Keynsian						
Expectations ("Animal Spirits") are the most significant influence on aggregate demand						
Wage rate is sticky in the downward direction						
Business cycles can be stabilized best by use of Fiscal and Monetary policy						
Keynesian economists believe that a market economy, if left alone, is unstable and likely to experience prolonged recessions. As a result, governments should run budget deficits during a recession in order to stimulate demand and direct the economy back to full employment.						
						
						
Monetarist						
The quantity of money is the most significant influence on aggregate demand						
Business cycles can be stabilized best by maintaining money supply growth steady and predictable						
The money wage rate is sticky						
						
Supply-Side Economists						
Promote tax cuts to encourage workers to work more labor hours to increase potential GDP (supply)						
						
Money, the Price Level, and Inflation						
						
Money						
Any means of payment for settling debt						
Medium of Exchange - widely accepted as a common form of payment						
Unit of Account - agreed unit for measuring value						
Store of Value - can be stored and used later as payment						
						
Money:						
Currency						
*Notes and coins inside banks are not counted as money						
Deposits (at banks and other depository institutions)						
						
M1						
Currency and travelor's checks						
Checking deposits						
						
M2						
M1						
Time deposits						
Savings deposits						
Money market mutual funds and other deposits						
						
Money Creation Process						
Banks create money by making loans!						
The amount of money that can be created depends on…						
(1) Monetary base						
(2) Desired reserve ratio						
(3) Currency drain ratio						
						
Monetary Base						
Federal Reserve notes (US dollar bills held by the public)						
Coins (issued by the Treasury)						
Banks' deposits at the Fed						
						
Services of Depository Institutions						
Create liquidity						
Minimize the cost of obtaining funds						
Minimize the cost of monitoring borrowers						
Pooling risk						
						
Banks borrow short and lend long.						
						
Monetary Policy						
						
Required Reserves = Demand Deposits * Required Reserve Ratio						
Excess Reserves = Actual Reserves - Required Researves						
						
Federal Reserve System ("The FED")						
Central Bank ("Banks' bank")						
Regulates nation's depository institutions						
Controls the quantity of money						
						
Goals of the Fed						
1.) Stable prices (1-2% inflation : %ΔCPI)						
2.) Full employment (zero cyclical unemployment)						
3.) Moderate long-term interest rates						
4.) Contribute to long-term real GDP growth						
						
Federal funds rate						
The rate that banks charge eachother on overnight loans of reserves						
						
Structure of the Fed						
Board of Governors (7 members)						
Regional Federal Reserve banks (12 banks)						
-provide check-clearing services to commercial banks and other depository institutions						
-hold the reserve accounts of commercial banks						
-issue the bank notes that circulate as currency						
Federal Open Market Committee						
						
Influences on Money Holding						
The price level - determines the buying power of cash in hand and need for more or less cash on hand						
The nominal interest rate - opportunity cost of holding money						
Real GDP - determines the amount of money being spent in the economy and demand for currency on hand						
Financial Innovation - creates alternatives for cash in hand (such as credit cards and interest-bearing accounts)

Taxes on Interest Income (Savings)						
The interest rate that influences savers is the real after-tax interest rate.						
Since taxes depend on the nominal rate, the higher the inflation rate, the higher the taxes on interest income						
When a tax on savings is imposed, the supply of loanable funds curve shifts leftward, increasing the equiblibrium real rate and decreasing the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds.						
						
						
Crowding-Out Effect						
A budget deficit shifts the supply of private loanable funds curve leftward, decreasing the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds and increasing the equilibrium real interest rate, reducing total Investment.						
						
A budget surplus increases the supply of private loanable funds, decreasing the equilibrium real interest rate, increasing the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds, increasing total Investment.						
						
Government stimulus in the form of spending more than the amount of tax revenues (budget deficit) dries up loanable funds to the business sector, increasing equilibrium real interest rates, and decreasing Investment.						
						
						
Economic Stimulus (via Interest Rate Targeting)						
The Fed buys short-term Treasury Securities						
The Supply of reserves increases						
The Federal Funds rate decreases						
The money supply increases (money multiplier effect)						
General interest rates decrease (the powerful substitution effect)						
Saving is less attractive, consumption increases						
Capital expenditures are more attractive, Investment increases						
Domestic interest rates become less attractive, the domestic currency depreciates						
Domestic products are more affordable to foreign consumers, increasing exports and decreasing imports, net exports increases						
Aggregate demand (real GDP, C+I+G+EX, assuming the price level does not change) increases						
Real GDP increases, the price level rises						
Labor wages adjust to inflation and the Marginal Cost of Production increases, shifting the Short-run Aggregate Supply curve leftward until it intersects the new Aggregate Demand at the potential level of real GDP						
						
						
Short-Term Rates vs. Long-Term Rates						
Short-term debt instruments are close substitutes						
Short-term interest rates and Long-term interest rates are only loosely linked						
Long-term interest rates influence consumer and business economic decisions						
If a decrease in short-term interest rates is triggered by inflationary money supply increases, long-term interest rates will incorporate the additional expected inflation, and decrease disproportionately						
						
						
If the central bank decreases the money supply unexpectedly, real wages increase because actual inflation is less than expected inflation. This causes a short-run decrease in aggregate supply (more expensive labor), decreasing real GDP growth and increasing the unemployment rate						
						
						
						
If inflation is expected, the fluctuations in real GDP that accompany demand-pull and cost-push inflation don't occur. Instead, inflation proceeds as it does in the long run with real GDP equal to potential GDP and unemployment at its natural rate.
