## Professional Standards (cont)

<a id="iii-duties-to-clients" />
### III. Duties to Clients

#### III(A) Loyalty, Prudence, and Care

    - Have a duty of loyalty, act with reasonable care, and exercise prudent judgment
    - Must act for the clients' interests and place their interests before their employer's and own self-interest
    - Make investment decisions in the context of the entire portfolio
    - Allowed to make preparations for future employment while still employed, as long as it doesn't affect loyalty to current employer
    - Soft dollar commissions must be used to benefit the client
    - Voting on proxies is only required for nonroutine issues with material impact
    - Client brokerage commissions must not be directed to pay for the investment manager's operating expenses

#### III(B) Fair Dealing

    - Must deal fairly and objectively when providing investment services
    - Must fairly disseminate investment information (to all clients) and trade for clients' accounts first
    - May accept unsolicited trade requests after notifying (verbal or written) a client of changes in recommendations before processing trades
    - Can offer different levels of service to clients, but must disclose this to all clients
    - Must provide reasonably sufficient time for clients to trade before making personal trades
    - Recommended to limit the number of people who know about changes to recommendations
    - Should forgo any sales to themselves or their immediate families to free up additional shares of oversubscribed stock issues for clients
    - Employers should compare personal transactions of employees with those of clients on a regular basis regardless of the existence of a requirement by any regulatory organization

#### III(C) Suitability

    - Must make reasonable inquiry into a client's investment experience, objectives and constraints, and regularly update this information
    - Suitability is judged in an overall portfolio context and not on a security-by-security basis - Make sure investment recommendations conicide with clients' written objectives
    - Brief communications are permitted (as brief as a list of recommended securities) as long as these recommendations are supported by appropriate background reports that can be made available to clients upon request. Sending a recommended list to all clients, even though not every recommended security is suitable for them, is not a violation of the Standards.
    - For unsolicited trades that conflict with investment objectives, must receive affirmative statement acknowledging that suitability is not a concern
    - Must updated Investment Policy Statement (IPS) at least annually
    - Suitability does not become a concern until an investor has taken action
    - For unsolicited trades that conflict with investment recommendations, must advise the client of the change in recommendation before accepting the order

#### III(D) Performance Presentation

    - Must make reasonable efforts to ensure that performance presentation is fair, accurate, and complete
    - Must include terminated accounts as part of historical performance
    - Consider the sophistication of audience
    - No minimum performance history is required
    - Simulated results can be reported, as long as this is disclosed
    - Must disclose if results are realized under the authority of another firm
    - Footnote disclosure is not enough to comply with this standard
    - Recommended to disseminate new recommendations to all clients who express an interest or for whom the investment is suitable
    - Must cite specific source of investment performance (e.g. "investment experts" is too vague)
    - Recommended to use GIPS in performance presentation

#### III(E) Preservation of Confidentiality

    - Must keep client information confidential unless:
            1. it involves illegal activities,
            2. disclosure is required by law, or
            3. the client permits disclosure

    - Must report illegal activity to employer first and then, if necessary, seek outside counsel
    - Can disclose confidential information to authorized fellow employees to ensure that a manager is aware of a client's needs and concerns
    - Must not disclose confidential information, even if it benefits the client
