#### II(A) Material Nonpublic Information

- Must not act or cause others to act on material nonpublic information (information that would likely have an impact on the price of a security or that reasonable investors would want to know before making an investment decision)
- Must make good-faith effort to prevent the transfer and misuse of material nonpublic information
- Disclosure in widely-used news sources would likely cause traders to act

  **Mosaic Theory**: nonmaterial, nonpublic information combined with
  research can be used to make investment decisions and recommendations

#### 
- An analyst conference call is not public disclosure.
- Information is nonpublic until it has been made available to the marketplace
- Recommended to restrict proprietary trading, but still make unsolicited trades
- Should provide an information firewall to limit transmittal of material nonpublic information within firm
- Common knowledge is regarded as "public" information
- Should first make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination and then, if necessary, disclose information only to designated supervisory and compliance personnel.
- A firm's internal information "firewall" should include a reporting system in which authorized personnel review and approve interdepartmental communications.


#### II(B) Market Manipulation

- Must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants
- Must not spread false information
- Whatever the motivation, the intent must not be to deceive market participants
