<h3>Monopolistic Competition</h3>
<ul>
<li>A market in which there are many similar, but slightly differentiated products which are close substitutes.
Each firm faces a downward sloping demand curve that shifts downward in the long-run until Price equals ATC (economic profit = 0)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Oligopoly</h3>
<ul>
<li>A market in which there are a few interdependent firms with significant barriers to entry (due to economies of scale)</li>
<li>Oligopolistic firms sometimes form cartels in which they agree to restrict production and raise prices</li>
</ul>
<h2>Factors of Production</h2>
<h3>Derived Demand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Demand for a factor of production driven by the demand for a product</li>
<li>Demand for factors of production are derived demands</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monopsony</h3>
<p>A market in which there is a single buyer
e.g. auto manufacturer as the single employer (buyer of labor)</p>
<h3>Factors of Production</h3>
<ol>
<li>Land</li>
<li>Labor</li>
<li>Capital</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship</li>
</ol>
<h3>Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The additional revenue from an additional unit of the factor of production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marginal revenue product curve is the firm&#x27;s short-run demand curve for the productive input</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A firm will use more units of input until the input&#x27;s marginal revenue product is equal to market price</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The demand for labor depends on the marginal revenue product of labor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The supply of labor faces two contradictory forces - (substitution effect) and (income effect).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quantity of labor increases as the wage rate increase but eventually bends backwords as workers value leisure more than work (income effect).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the level of labor input where marginal product is greatest, marginal cost is at its minimum. Marginal cost then increases as more labor input is added. Up to the point where average product is greatest, average variable cost decreases as labor input increases.</p>
<p>Industries that are labor intensive will be more sensitive to the wage rate and will adjust employment more for a given change in the wage rate.</p>
<p>Labor responds to real wages, net of inflation and payroll taxes</p>
<p>Renewable (re-useable)Natural Resource
Supply of renewable resources is fixed (perfectly in-elastic)
Supply is called &quot;known stock&quot;
Example: land</p>
<p>Non-renewable Natural Resource
Supply is pefectly elastic at a price that equals the present value of its future price
Hotelling principle: If resource prices are expected to increase by less than the risk-free rate, suppliers will increase current production and invest proceeds at the risk-free rate</p>
<p>Example: oil</p>
<p>Historical Funding Sources for Private Business in U.S.
1.) Loans (60%)
2.) Bonds (30%)
3.) Equities (2%)</p>
<p>Opportunity Cost
The amount necessary to bid a factor of production away from its next-highest-valued alternative use</p>
<p>Economic Rent
The income above the opportunity cost of capital earned by an owner of a factor of production</p>
<p>Aggregate Supply (AS)
Short-run Aggregate Supply (SAS)
Workers&#x27; wage demands are constant
Increase in expected future inflation increases higher wage demands, Marginal Cost of production increases, and short-run aggregate supply shifts leftward.</p>
<p>Long-run Aggregate Supply (LAS)
Expected inflation equals actual inflation
Full employment (zero cyclical unemployment)
Potential real output (GDP) of economy</p>
<p>Determinants of Aggregate Supply (LAS)
Quantity of labor
Quantity of capital
Technology</p>
<p>Aggregate Demand (AD)
Aggregate Expenditures (AE) = C+I+G+NX
Aggregate Demand (AD) = relationship between aggregate expenditures (AE = C+I+G+NX) and the price level (P)
Prices increase → Interest rates increase: When the price level rises, individuals and businesses have less real money and must borrow, therefore the demand for loanable funds increases, thereby increasing the interest rate.</p>
<p>Wealth effect - At higher price levels,  individuals and businesses have less wealth and therefore begin to spend less
Substitution effect - At higher price levels, the demand for loanable funds increases as individuals need more to maintain real spending levels, causing an increase in interest rates.  Consequently, higher interest rates reduce current spending as individuals and  businesses save at higher opportunity costs of spending (saving is more valuable than spending)</p>
<p>Shifts in Aggregrate Demand Curve
Shifts in expectations about inflation, income and future profits
Monetary and Fiscal policy
World economy</p>
<p>Types of Unemployment
Frictional Unemployment (permanent) - unemployment arrising from normal turnover - entering and leaving the labor force and from ongoing cration and destruction of jobs.</p>
<p>Structural Unemployment (long-term) - unemployment caused by changes in technology that force workers to improve skills.
Cyclical Unemployment - unemployment caused by the business cycle.</p>
<p>Full Employment
Situation when there is no cyclical unemployment
Produces the natural unemployment rate</p>
<p>Potential GDP
GDP output at full employment</p>
<p>Business Cycle
Growth, inflation, and business cycles arise from the relentless increases in potential GDP, faster (on the average) increases in aggregate demand, and fluctuations in the pace of aggregate demand growth</p>
<p>The cyclical nature of Real GDP around potential GDP that is caused by the stickiness of money wage rates and its tendency to adjust slower than the price level</p>
<p>An increase in the quantity of money at full employment will reduce interest rates in the short run, which would increase short-run aggregate demand above full employment. This causes wage demands to increase, which in turn reduces short-run aggregate suply. In the long run, real GDP reverts to its full-employment level with an increase in price level equal to the percentage increase in the quantity of money.</p>
<p>Workers lose the buying power of their wages and demand more from their employers, causing an increase in each firm&#x27;s Marginal Cost curve and a leftward shift in the Short-run aggregate supply curve, which further increases the price level, but brings GDP back to its long-term equilibrium level (potential GDP - GDP with zero cyclical unemployment)</p>
<p>The economy &quot;overheats&quot; if the real GDP grows much faster than the money wage rate, requiring a sharp correction as workers demand more wages and real output raises prices and reduces output to accomadate the higher wage costs.</p>
<p>Stagflation (recession and inflation) occurs when short-run aggregate supply decreases, causing higher prices and less output (GDP)</p>
<p>Deflation
A persistent decline in prices.  Consumers respond by delaying consumption which reduces Aggregate Demand and Real GDP.</p>
<p>Mainstream Business Cycle Theory
Cause of business cycle is due to variations in the growth of Aggregate Demand
Potential GDP grows at a steady rate
Money wage rate is sticky</p>
<p>Real Business Cycle Theory (newest)
The real business cycle is caused by changes in technology that bring fluctuations in the growth rate of Productivity
Changes in technology will affect:
1.) Investment demand
2.) Demand for labor</p>
<p>GDP Gap
GDP Gap = Potential GDP - Real GDP
Recessionary Gap:      Real GDP &lt; potential GDP
Inflationary Gap:         Real GDP &gt; potential GDP</p>
<p>Short-Run Phillips Curve
Inflation and unemployment curve
Holds expected inflation and natural unemployment rate constant
A decrease in expected inflation shifts short-run Phillips curve down
If inflation rises above its expected rate, unemployment falls below its natural rate</p>
<p>Long-Run Phillips Curve
Vertical line at the natural unemployment rate
An increase in the natural unemployment rate shifts LRPC and SRPC rightward</p>
<p>Macroeconomic Schools of Thought</p>
<p>Classical
Economy is self-regulating and always at full employment
Technological change is most significant influence on AggDem and AggSupp</p>
<p>Keynsian
Expectations (&quot;Animal Spirits&quot;) are the most significant influence on aggregate demand
Wage rate is sticky in the downward direction
Business cycles can be stabilized best by use of Fiscal and Monetary policy
Keynesian economists believe that a market economy, if left alone, is unstable and likely to experience prolonged recessions. As a result, governments should run budget deficits during a recession in order to stimulate demand and direct the economy back to full employment.</p>
<p>Monetarist
The quantity of money is the most significant influence on aggregate demand
Business cycles can be stabilized best by maintaining money supply growth steady and predictable
The money wage rate is sticky</p>
<p>Supply-Side Economists
Promote tax cuts to encourage workers to work more labor hours to increase potential GDP (supply)</p>
<p>Money, the Price Level, and Inflation</p>
<p>Money
Any means of payment for settling debt
Medium of Exchange - widely accepted as a common form of payment
Unit of Account - agreed unit for measuring value
Store of Value - can be stored and used later as payment</p>
<p>Money:
Currency
*Notes and coins inside banks are not counted as money
Deposits (at banks and other depository institutions)</p>
<p>M1
Currency and travelor&#x27;s checks
Checking deposits</p>
<p>M2
M1
Time deposits
Savings deposits
Money market mutual funds and other deposits</p>
<p>Money Creation Process
Banks create money by making loans!
The amount of money that can be created depends on…
(1) Monetary base
(2) Desired reserve ratio
(3) Currency drain ratio</p>
<p>Monetary Base
Federal Reserve notes (US dollar bills held by the public)
Coins (issued by the Treasury)
Banks&#x27; deposits at the Fed</p>
<p>Services of Depository Institutions
Create liquidity
Minimize the cost of obtaining funds
Minimize the cost of monitoring borrowers
Pooling risk</p>
<p>Banks borrow short and lend long.</p>
<p>Monetary Policy</p>
<p>Required Reserves = Demand Deposits * Required Reserve Ratio
Excess Reserves = Actual Reserves - Required Researves</p>
<p>Federal Reserve System (&quot;The FED&quot;)
Central Bank (&quot;Banks&#x27; bank&quot;)
Regulates nation&#x27;s depository institutions
Controls the quantity of money</p>
<p>Goals of the Fed
1.) Stable prices (1-2% inflation : %ΔCPI)
2.) Full employment (zero cyclical unemployment)
3.) Moderate long-term interest rates
4.) Contribute to long-term real GDP growth</p>
<p>Federal funds rate
The rate that banks charge eachother on overnight loans of reserves</p>
<p>Structure of the Fed
Board of Governors (7 members)
Regional Federal Reserve banks (12 banks)
-provide check-clearing services to commercial banks and other depository institutions
-hold the reserve accounts of commercial banks
-issue the bank notes that circulate as currency
Federal Open Market Committee</p>
<p>Influences on Money Holding
The price level - determines the buying power of cash in hand and need for more or less cash on hand
The nominal interest rate - opportunity cost of holding money
Real GDP - determines the amount of money being spent in the economy and demand for currency on hand
Financial Innovation - creates alternatives for cash in hand (such as credit cards and interest-bearing accounts)</p>
<p>FY2007 Federal Budget
*not subject to GAAP, so may be produced using Cash Accounting method

2,891 	100%</p>
<p>Deficit (new borrowing by the Treasury)			 (370)	-15%	% of tax revenues</p>
<p>Taxes on Interest Income (Savings)
The interest rate that influences savers is the real after-tax interest rate.
Since taxes depend on the nominal rate, the higher the inflation rate, the higher the taxes on interest income
When a tax on savings is imposed, the supply of loanable funds curve shifts leftward, increasing the equiblibrium real rate and decreasing the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds.</p>
<p>Crowding-Out Effect
A budget deficit shifts the supply of private loanable funds curve leftward, decreasing the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds and increasing the equilibrium real interest rate, reducing total Investment.</p>
<p>A budget surplus increases the supply of private loanable funds, decreasing the equilibrium real interest rate, increasing the equilibrium quantity of loanable funds, increasing total Investment.</p>
<p>Government stimulus in the form of spending more than the amount of tax revenues (budget deficit) dries up loanable funds to the business sector, increasing equilibrium real interest rates, and decreasing Investment.</p>
<p>Economic Stimulus (via Interest Rate Targeting)
The Fed buys short-term Treasury Securities
The Supply of reserves increases
The Federal Funds rate decreases
The money supply increases (money multiplier effect)
General interest rates decrease (the powerful substitution effect)
Saving is less attractive, consumption increases
Capital expenditures are more attractive, Investment increases
Domestic interest rates become less attractive, the domestic currency depreciates
Domestic products are more affordable to foreign consumers, increasing exports and decreasing imports, net exports increases
Aggregate demand (real GDP, C+I+G+EX, assuming the price level does not change) increases
Real GDP increases, the price level rises
Labor wages adjust to inflation and the Marginal Cost of Production increases, shifting the Short-run Aggregate Supply curve leftward until it intersects the new Aggregate Demand at the potential level of real GDP</p>
<p>Short-Term Rates vs. Long-Term Rates
Short-term debt instruments are close substitutes
Short-term interest rates and Long-term interest rates are only loosely linked
Long-term interest rates influence consumer and business economic decisions
If a decrease in short-term interest rates is triggered by inflationary money supply increases, long-term interest rates will incorporate the additional expected inflation, and decrease disproportionately</p>
<p>If the central bank decreases the money supply unexpectedly, real wages increase because actual inflation is less than expected inflation. This causes a short-run decrease in aggregate supply (more expensive labor), decreasing real GDP growth and increasing the unemployment rate</p>
<p>If inflation is expected, the fluctuations in real GDP that accompany demand-pull and cost-push inflation don&#x27;t occur. Instead, inflation proceeds as it does in the long run with real GDP equal to potential GDP and unemployment at its natural rate.</p><div class="my-8"></div><hr class="text-slate-300"/><div class="flex justify-around items-center gap-4 my-4"><a class="flex gap-1 px-4 border border-slate-300 dark:hover:border-slate-200 rounded dark:hover:text-slate-200 dark:text-slate-300 no-underline" href="/blog/cfa-level-1/macroeconomics-1"><div class="text-xl">⇽</div><div class="py-[5px] text-sm">Back</div></a></div></article></div><div class="bg-slate-400 dark:bg-slate-900 border-slate-100/50 border-t-2 w-screen h-12"><div class="flex justify-center items-center py-1 h-full">© <!-- -->2025<!-- --> Free Analyst Notes.
